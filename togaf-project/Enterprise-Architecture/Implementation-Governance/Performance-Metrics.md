# Performance Metrics for Implementation Governance

## Introduction
This document outlines the key performance metrics that will be used to measure the success of the implementation of the architecture as defined in the TOGAF framework. These metrics will help in assessing the effectiveness, efficiency, and overall impact of the implemented solutions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Project Delivery Timeliness**
   - Measure the percentage of project milestones achieved on time.
   - Target: 90% of milestones met as per the project timeline.

2. **Budget Adherence**
   - Track the variance between the planned budget and actual expenditure.
   - Target: Maintain budget variance within Â±10%.

3. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**
   - Conduct surveys to gauge stakeholder satisfaction with the implementation process and outcomes.
   - Target: Achieve a satisfaction score of 80% or higher.

4. **Quality of Deliverables**
   - Assess the number of defects or issues reported post-implementation.
   - Target: Less than 5% of deliverables should require rework.

5. **User Adoption Rate**
   - Measure the percentage of users actively using the new systems or processes within a specified timeframe post-implementation.
   - Target: Achieve an adoption rate of 75% within three months of rollout.

6. **System Performance**
   - Monitor system uptime and response times to ensure they meet predefined service level agreements (SLAs).
   - Target: 99.9% uptime and response times within acceptable limits.

7. **Return on Investment (ROI)**
   - Calculate the financial return generated from the implementation relative to the costs incurred.
   - Target: Achieve a positive ROI within the first year of implementation.

## Reporting and Review
- Performance metrics will be reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure alignment with project goals and to make necessary adjustments.
- A dashboard will be created to visualize key metrics for stakeholders and project teams.

## Conclusion
These performance metrics will serve as a foundation for evaluating the success of the implementation governance process, ensuring that the project delivers value and meets its objectives effectively.
