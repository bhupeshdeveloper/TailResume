# Principles

1. **Modularity**:
   - Separate concerns into distinct components (frontend, backend, build system).

2. **Scalability**:
   - Design the architecture to support future growth and additional features.

3. **Portability**:
   - Use Docker to ensure the application can run on any machine.

4. **Usability**:
   - Prioritize a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation.

5. **Maintainability**:
   - Use modern technologies and best practices to ensure the codebase is easy to maintain.
