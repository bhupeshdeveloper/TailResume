# Security Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document outlines the security architecture and policies that will be implemented within the project. It aims to ensure that all aspects of security are considered and integrated into the overall architecture.

## Security Objectives
- Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
- Maintain the integrity and availability of systems and data.
- Provide a secure environment for users and applications.

## Security Principles
1. **Least Privilege**: Users and systems should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions.
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls should be implemented to protect against various threats.
3. **Security by Design**: Security considerations should be integrated into the design and development processes from the outset.
4. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and regular audits should be conducted to identify and mitigate security risks.

## Security Policies
- **Access Control Policy**: Defines how access to systems and data is managed and enforced.
- **Data Protection Policy**: Outlines measures for protecting sensitive data, including encryption and data masking.
- **Incident Response Policy**: Establishes procedures for responding to security incidents and breaches.
- **Acceptable Use Policy**: Specifies acceptable behaviors and practices for users accessing the organization's systems.

## Risk Management
- Identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities.
- Assess the impact and likelihood of identified risks.
- Implement mitigation strategies to reduce risks to acceptable levels.

## Conclusion
The security architecture is a critical component of the overall enterprise architecture, ensuring that security is prioritized and integrated throughout the project lifecycle. Regular reviews and updates to this document will be necessary to adapt to evolving security threats and compliance requirements.
