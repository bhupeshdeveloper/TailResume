# Migration Steps

## Development Environment
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
3. Compile Tailwind CSS:
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm node

---
# Production Environment
1. Push the code to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean) with Docker support.
3. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate builds and deployments.
