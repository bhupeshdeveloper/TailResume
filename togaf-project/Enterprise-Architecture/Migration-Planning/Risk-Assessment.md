# Risk Assessment

## Introduction
This document outlines the risk assessment for the migration to the target architecture. It identifies potential risks, their impact, likelihood, and proposed mitigation strategies.

## Risk Identification
1. **Technical Risks**
   - **Risk:** Incompatibility with existing systems
     - **Impact:** High
     - **Likelihood:** Medium
     - **Mitigation:** Conduct thorough compatibility testing and create a fallback plan.

   - **Risk:** Data loss during migration
     - **Impact:** High
     - **Likelihood:** Low
     - **Mitigation:** Implement robust data backup and recovery procedures.

2. **Project Management Risks**
   - **Risk:** Scope creep
     - **Impact:** Medium
     - **Likelihood:** High
     - **Mitigation:** Establish clear project scope and change management processes.

   - **Risk:** Resource availability
     - **Impact:** Medium
     - **Likelihood:** Medium
     - **Mitigation:** Ensure resource allocation is planned and monitored throughout the project.

3. **Stakeholder Risks**
   - **Risk:** Resistance to change from stakeholders
     - **Impact:** Medium
     - **Likelihood:** High
     - **Mitigation:** Engage stakeholders early and provide training and support.

   - **Risk:** Misalignment of stakeholder expectations
     - **Impact:** Medium
     - **Likelihood:** Medium
     - **Mitigation:** Regular communication and updates to manage expectations.

## Risk Monitoring
- Regularly review and update the risk assessment throughout the project lifecycle.
- Establish a risk management team to oversee risk mitigation efforts.

## Conclusion
Effective risk management is crucial for the successful migration to the target architecture. By identifying potential risks and implementing mitigation strategies, the project can minimize disruptions and achieve its objectives.
