# Gap Analysis

## Introduction
The purpose of this gap analysis is to identify the differences between the current (baseline) architecture and the desired (target) architecture. This analysis will help in understanding the areas that require improvement and the steps needed to bridge the gaps.

## Current State Assessment
- **Description of Current Architecture**: Provide a brief overview of the existing architecture, including its components, technologies, and processes.
- **Strengths**: List the strengths of the current architecture that should be retained.
- **Weaknesses**: Identify the weaknesses and limitations of the current architecture.

## Target State Definition
- **Description of Target Architecture**: Outline the desired architecture, including its components, technologies, and processes.
- **Goals and Objectives**: Define the goals and objectives that the target architecture aims to achieve.

## Gap Identification
- **Functional Gaps**: Identify any functional requirements that are not met by the current architecture.
- **Technical Gaps**: Highlight any technical capabilities that are lacking in the current architecture.
- **Process Gaps**: Describe any process inefficiencies or deficiencies present in the current architecture.

## Gap Analysis Summary
- **Summary Table**: Create a table that summarizes the identified gaps, including their impact and priority for resolution.

| Gap Description | Current State | Target State | Impact | Priority |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|--------|----------|
|                  |               |              |        |          |

## Recommendations
- **Action Plan**: Provide recommendations for addressing each identified gap, including potential solutions and timelines for implementation.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings of the gap analysis and emphasize the importance of addressing the identified gaps to achieve the desired architecture.
