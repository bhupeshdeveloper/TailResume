# Data Security

## Security Measures
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all form inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

2. **HTTPS**:
   - Use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.

3. **Container Security**:
   - Use official Docker images for PHP, Node.js, and Nginx.
   - Regularly update Docker images to patch vulnerabilities.

4. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
   - Use `.htaccess` or Nginx rules to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Disable detailed error messages in production to avoid exposing sensitive information.
